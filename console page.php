						The slogan “more than a Club” expresses the commitment that <strong>Futbol
							Club Barcelona</strong> has maintained and still maintains beyond
						what belongs in the realm of sport. For many years, this
						commitment specifically referred to Catalan society, which for
						many decades of the 20th century lived under dictatorships that
						persecuted its language and culture. Under these circumstances,
						Barça always supported Catalan sentiments, and the defence of its
						own language and culture.
					</p>

					<p>It was because of this,even though Catalan was not an official
						language, that in 1921 the club drafted its statutes in the
						language of Catalonia. It was also in this era that in 1918 the
						club adhered to a petition for a statute of autonomy for
						Catalonia, which was being demanded from all sectors of the
						catalanista movement.</p>

					<p>
						The club’s position&nbsp;led to reprisals from the Spanish
						authorities and it was closed down for six months under the <strong>Primo
							de Rivera</strong> dictatorship. During the Second Spanish
						Republic, the club intensified its message of implication with
						Catalonia’s own culture and institutions. President <strong>Josep
							Suñol</strong> led this process using the slogan “sport and
						citizenship”, the purpose being to imply sports in the country’s
						social and cultural affairs.<br> <br> Suñol, who was also a member
						of parliament, was shot dead early in the Spanish Civil War in
						1936; and from then on, the Club came to be an icon of the defence
						of the Republic, as shown by the tour of Mexico and the United
						States in 1937. When the Civil War ended, General Franco’s
						dictatorship sought to destroy the club’s social significance.
					</p>

					<p>
						It enforced the Spanish version of its name and the removal of the
						four Catalan stripes from the badge. Despite the dictatorship’s
						persistence, in the late 1960s the Club started&nbsp;recovering
						its former spirit,&nbsp;evident in&nbsp;the speeches of President
						Narcís de Carreras, the man who coined the famous phrase&nbsp;<strong>“more
							than a Club”</strong> in 1968. Outside of Catalonia, in many
						parts of Spain, Barça also became a symbol&nbsp;of democracy and
						anti-centralism. When democracy returned after the death of
						Franco, the Club maintained its social commitment and new ways of
						supporting good&nbsp;causes emerged, which would later be
						encompassed by the creation of the Club’s Foundation.<br> <br> Now
						in the age of globalisation, Barça has extended its social
						commitment to the rest of the planet, with a specially significant
						event being the signing of an agreement with <strong>Unicef</strong>
						in 2006, which was a way of saying that a sports club should not
						be marginal to problems going on in society, in this case, the
						plight of children around the world. Because of this, Barça
						continues to be “more than a Club” both in Catalonia and elsewhere
						in the world, and is implied in numerous cultural, social and
						charity initiatives.
					</p>

					<p>
						Below we take a look at the four of the defining traits of Futbol
						Club Barcelona.<br> <br> <strong>CATALANISM</strong>: Since its
						very foundation, FC Barcelona has been intrinsically linked to its
						country, Catalonia, a commitment that comes from society as a
						whole and one that is understood by Barça fans in the rest of
						Spain and in the rest of the world. The Club firmly and strongly
						promotes Catalonia around the world. Barça supports an integrated,
						multicultural, fair and caring Catalonia.<br> <br> <strong>UNIVERSALITY:</strong>
						When the Club anthem says ‘it does not matter where you come
						from’, it expresses the spirit of an institution open to everyone,
						that brings together fans from around the five continents and
						links them to a history in which half of the Club’s founders were
						from outside Catalonia. FC Barcelona has members and supporters’
						clubs in more than 50 countries, from Cameroon to China, millions
						of fans come together to make Barça great.<br> <br> <strong>SOCIAL
							COMMITMENT:</strong> Barça is an open club, one that brings
						people together and promotes positive values on a daily basis
						whether it be via its own Foundation, via agreements with
						international institutions such as UNICEF, or via collaborations
						with local organisations such as ‘Banc dels Aliments’. These
						projects are usually developed in areas such as educations, the
						arts and culture as well as in community support and developmental
						aid.&nbsp;<br> <br> <strong>DEMOCRACY</strong>: The Club members
						are also its owners and they decide democratically who it is that
						ought to run FC Barcelona. The democratic principle is a
						fundamental pillar of the Club and it has only been neglected when
						dictatorships have intervened. Today Barça is one of the few big
						European clubs that is run democratically, another factor in its
						unique appeal.
